## About me 
I’m someone who loves being active and spending time outdoors, whether it’s hiking through nature or getting a good workout in, I enjoy anything that keeps me moving. I also have a passion for cooking, especially making traditional Honduran dishes that remind me of home and my roots. Traveling is another big part of my life; this past summer I had the chance to explore several beach destinations, which was an amazing experience. Now I’m already looking ahead and getting excited for my next big adventure, traveling through Europe next summer. I can’t wait to see new places, try different foods, and experience everything each country has to offer.
## My CSC340 Goals 
In this course, I hope to gain a strong foundation in the principles and practices involved in building large-scale, real-world software systems. I'm especially interested in learning how to approach complex problems with efficient solution that can be applied in real professional environments. Since this is writing-intensive course, I also look forward to improving my ability to communicate technical ideas clearly and effectively. I want to leave this class with a better understanding of what it takes to deliver high quality software.
