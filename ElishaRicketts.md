##About Me
I live in Greensboro and am currently in my Senior year at UNCG. I spend my free time reading, drawing, and just started weightlifting again. I work part time at an arcade where I do repair work on electronics. The most enjoyable part of the job is diagnosing.

##My CSC340 Goals
I hope to get a better understanding of workflow in a software engineering environment and to learn how to work smoothy and collarboratively within a team. I would also like to see the design process for user friendly interfaces.
