### 1.5 Document Overview
This Software Requirements Document (SRD) for SpartanFitness is organized into three sections. Section 1 provides a general introduction to the document and the system, outlining its purpose, scope, and overall objectives for all readers. Section 2 focuses on the product and its features, describing the value SpartanFitness offers, the user groups it supports, and the key functionality available, this section is primarily intended for customers. Section 3 details the specific requirements and constraints of the system and development process, covering functional, non-functional, and technical considerations.

## 2. Product Overview
SpartanFitness is web-based platform designed to help individuals of all fitness levels access structured training programs, workout resources, and progress tracking tools. Users can explore customized exercise routines, monitors their performance over time, and engage with a supportive community to stay motivated. Trainers can create and share personalized workout plans, track client achievements, and provide feedback directly through the system. The platform supports multiple user roles, including members, trainers, and administrators, each tailored tools to ensure an engaging effective, and goal-oritented fitness experience.

### 2.1 Product Functions
Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or object class diagram, is often effective.

### 2.2 Product Constraints
This subsection should provide a general description of any other items that will limit the developerâ€™s options. These may include:  

* Interfaces to users, other applications or hardware.  
* Quality of service constraints.  
* Standards compliance.  
* Constraints around design or implementation.
  
### 2.3 User Characteristics
Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class. Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the most important user classes for this product from those who are less important to satisfy.

### 2.4 Assumptions and Dependencies
List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).
